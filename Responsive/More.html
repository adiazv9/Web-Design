             <h2>History and Construction</h2>
            <ul>
           <li>First Built (27 BCE - 25 BCE): The Pantheon was commissioned by Marcus Agrippa, the general and statesman under Emperor Augustus. However, the structure we see today was rebuilt by Emperor Hadrian around 118-125 CE after the original building was destroyed by fire. </li>  <li>Purpose: It was originally constructed as a temple dedicated to all the Roman gods, which is reflected in its name, "Pantheon" (from the Greek "pan" meaning "all" and "theos" meaning "god").</li>
            <li>Conversion to a Church: In the 7th century, the Pantheon was consecrated as a Christian church, which helped preserve it through the centuries.</li>

          <h3>Architectural Features </h3>
        <ul>
      <li>Rotunda and Dome: The most notable feature of the Pantheon is its massive circular rotunda and the incredible dome, which is still the worldâ€™s largest unreinforced concrete dome. The dome's oculus, a 27-foot wide hole in the center, allows natural light to illuminate the interior and serves as a symbolic connection between the temple and the heavens.</li>  
      
      <li>Portico: The front of the Pantheon is adorned with a classical portico of 16 Corinthian columns made from Egyptian granite, with a bronze door that is over 1,000 years old.</li>  
            
      <li>Dimensions: The Pantheon is perfectly symmetrical, with both the height and diameter of the dome measuring 43.3 meters (142 feet), creating a sense of harmony and balance.</li>      
            </ul>
