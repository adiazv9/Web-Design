        <p>The Colosseum, located in the heart of Rome near the Roman Forum, is a true marvel of ancient engineering. Construction began under Emperor Vespasian in 72 AD and was completed by his son, Titus, in 80 AD. Standing about 48 meters (157 feet) tall, the Colosseum spans 188 meters (615 feet) in length and 156 meters (510 feet) in width, with a capacity to hold up to 50,000 spectators. Its elliptical shape and the intricate design of its concrete and stone structure make it one of the most iconic landmarks of the ancient world. The Colosseum features 80 entrance arches and a complex network of tunnels beneath the arena, showcasing the advanced architectural and engineering techniques of the Romans.</p>
